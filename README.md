# Fake-News-Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a Fake News Detection System using Machine Learning and techniques. The goal is to classify news articles as Fake or Real based on their textual content. With the rapid spread of misinformation online, this system helps in identifying unreliable news automatically.

## Features

Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)

Feature extraction using NLP techniques

Machine learning model training and evaluation

Manual testing for custom news input

Clear classification output: Fake News or Not Fake News

## Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

NLTK

Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset contains labeled news articles with:

Text – News content

Label –

     0 → Fake News
     
     1 → Real News

## How It Works

Load and explore the dataset

Clean and preprocess the news text

Convert text into numerical features

Train machine learning models

Evaluate model performance

Test new news articles manually

## Results

The model achieves good accuracy and effectively distinguishes between fake and real news articles using text-based features.
