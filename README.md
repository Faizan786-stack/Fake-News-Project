# Fake-News-Project
📰 Fake News Detection System
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a Fake News Detection System using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to classify news articles as Fake or Real based on their textual content. With the rapid spread of misinformation online, this system helps in identifying unreliable news automatically.

🚀 Features

Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)

Feature extraction using NLP techniques

Machine learning model training and evaluation

Manual testing for custom news input

Clear classification output: Fake News or Not Fake News

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

NLTK

Jupyter Notebook

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains labeled news articles with:

Text – News content

Label –

0 → Fake News

1 → Real News
